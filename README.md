# Testing

I have deployed the website through git-hub pages and tested it there. The wesite looks good visually, and keeps good structure when viewed on different screen sizes in dev tool. All internal links where tested and work. All external links were tested and open up in new pages. When first deploying the page, no css was being applied to the html due to miss-spelling in the css link. This was an easy fix. Also, when submitting the signup, it was naot opening in a new tab as i had forgotten the target="\_blank" attribute. It now opens in a new tab.
